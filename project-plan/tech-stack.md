* Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/Django
* Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
* APIs: Weather data (OpenWeatherMap, Weather.gov), satellite imagery (Sentinel, Google Earth Engine)

### Data Sources (Free/Loa-Cost)

* Weather forecasts: OpenWeatherMap API (free tier)
* Soil information: ISRIC SoilGrids (open data)

### MVP Development Plan

* Build the irrigation recommendation engine first
* Add the mobile interface with basic input forms
* Integrate free weather API data
* Implement basic user accounts and data storage
* Add water budget calculator functionality
* Expand with community features once you have initial users
